# GlunadierFirstPerson

Developed with Unreal Engine 5
"Glunadier" is my personal game project, meant to give me the experience of pulling together a game project all my myself. It's a mix between an arena shooter and a puzzle game, where the main catch is that you can only use non-lethal grenades to defend yourself.
